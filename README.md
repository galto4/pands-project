### Section 1: About the Project (Overview)

This repository contains my exploratory data analysis of the Fisher Iris data set, as part of the 'Programming & Scripting' module with ATU.

### Section 2: About the Dataset

1. <b>data.csv</b>: This CSV file contains the Iris dataset which was taken directly from [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv) and created directly in my own repository.
2. <b>iris.ipynb</b>: This Jupyter notebook contains all (Python) code use for the exploratory analysis of the Iris dataset. It also includes data exploration, data visualisation, data and statistical analysis, and references for my learning.
3. <b>analyze.py</b>: This Python program includes all code required to (a) output a summary of each variable to a single text file, (b) save a histogram of each variable to png files, and (c) outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
4. <b>README.md</b>: This file (you're reading it) continue an overview of the repository, including the dataset, it's features, and the context behind the analysis.

### Section 3: About the Dataset

The Fisher Iris data set was introduced by biologist [Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ronald-Aylmer-Fisher) in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. It contains 50 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor).
<br><br>
Four features were measured (from each of the samples); the length and width of sepal and petal (in cm). Based on the combination of the four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from one another.

### Section 4: Approach to Analysis

The analysis of the Fisher Iris data set was broken down into the following parts:

- <b>Import Libraries</b>: All important libraries (Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib) were loaded to to facilitate thorough investigation of the dataset.
- <b>Data Loading</b>: The 'Iris' data was then loaded from a CSV file which was created with my repository, and subsequently validated.
- <b>Data Inspection</b>: The data was reviewed to check for data types and structure, missing cells, unique values, etc. 
- <b>Data Visualisation</b>: Creation of visualisations such as bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots to visualise the relationships between variables and across specific species.
-<b>Correlation Analysis</b>: Analysis of how correlated data variables are across the Iris dataset.
