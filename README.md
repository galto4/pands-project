### Section 2: About the Data Set

The Fisher Iris data set was introduced by biologist [Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ronald-Aylmer-Fisher) in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. It contains 50 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor).
<br><br>
Four features were measured (from each of the samples); the length and width of sepal and petal (in cm). Based on the combination of the four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from one another.

### Section 3: Approach to Analysis

The analysis of the Fisher Iris data set was broken down into the following parts:

- <b>Import Libraries</b>: All important libraries (Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib) were loaded to to facilitate thorough investigation of the dataset.
- <b>Load the Data</b>: The 'Palmer Penguins' data was then loaded into my notebook, and validate
- <b>Inspect the Data</b>: The data was reviewed to check for data types and structure, missing cells, unique values, etc. 
- <b>Data Variables</b>: A light review of the variable types to assess what type of analysis could be performed.
- <b>Data Visualisation</b>: Using Histogram and Bar Charts to analyse and illustrate the dataset.
-<b>Correlation Analysis</b>: Analysis of how correlated data variables are across the dataset.
